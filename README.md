# Ex-Habit: A Habit Change Journal

## Description
Ex-Habit is a journal for tracking habit loops. Habit loops are cyclical patterns of behavior, consisting of a trigger or cue, a behavior, and a result or reward. Ex-Habit organizes your journal by triggers and behaviors, allowing you to see over time how these show up in your life. The goal is to increase awareness, especially awareness of what you get from your habit loops.
